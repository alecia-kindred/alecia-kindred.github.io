	<h1>Scenic Route Bakery</h1>
	<h2 class="project_type"><span>//</span> Mobile App</h2>
	<p>Over the course of 3 months, I completed courses two through five for the Google UX Design Professional Certificate in which I learned and followed the UX design process, which included user research, creating paper wireframes, digital wireframes, and a low-fidelity prototype, conducting a usability study, and finally creating mockups and a high-fidelity prototype. During these courses I also learned a new tool: Figma.</p>
	<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Customers do not have a quick, easy way to submit orders for pickup or delivery.</p>
	<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Design a food menu app for Scenic Route Bakery that will allow customers to submit orders for pickup or delivery.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>User Research</h2>
	<p>During my user research I created two personas with individual ways, needs, frustrations, and goals related to the Scenic Route Bakery app that helped drive the direction of the final app.</p>

	</div>
	<p>I also created a user flow for the app I was planning to design to make sure the flow of the pages made sense and I wasn't missing anything.</p>

	<h2>Wireframes</h2>
	<p>When creating paper wireframes, my focus was on the homepage and what elements should be included and how the user would navigate the app.</p>

	<p>With the digital wireframes, my goal was to create all the necessary screens to determine what elements would be needed on each page. Digital wireframes were created in Figma.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Usability Study</h2>
	<p>During the usability study, users had some confusion navigating the app, though all were able to successfully complete the assigned tasks. Below are some of the usability study findings.</p>
	<div class="flex">
		<div class="finding"><span>1</span> There was no option to save while editing an item</div>
		<div class="finding"><span>2</span> The navigation was confusing and hard to find the menu</div>
		<div class="finding"><span>3</span> There were too many clicks to find menu items</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<h2>Mockups</h2>
	<p>Mockups were created in Figma as a representation of the final app design. The homepage design was updated based on findings from the usability study to include tabs as an easier way for customers to access the full menu. New pages were also created that had been missing in the wireframe creation.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
	<p>Throughout the design process, the following accessibility considerations were made to ensure the app could be easily used by all.</p>
	<div class="flex">
		<div class="consideration"><span>1</span> Alternative options to using gestures are provided and gestures (such as swiping) are not the only way to complete a task</div>
		<div class="consideration"><span>2</span> Colors meet the required color contrasts to be accessible based on WCAG standards</div>
		<div class="consideration"><span>3</span> Graphical cues are provided to guide non-literate users and people with cognitive disabilities by combining text with icons and images</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<h2>Takeaways</h2>
	<p>Throughout this process I learned to keep the user the focus of my designs and that making designs accessible benefits everyone. I also learned that my first idea is not always the best idea and feedback only helps me become a better designer.</p>
